What I Worked On

Performed data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas (handled missing values, corrected data types, removed duplicates).

Created derived columns such as total sales and profit using business logic.

Designed key business KPIs including total revenue, total profit, profit margin, monthly growth rate, and region-wise performance.

Conducted time-series analysis to identify monthly and yearly sales trends.

Analyzed product-level performance to identify top-selling and most profitable products.

Performed region-wise sales and profit analysis to compare market performance.

Built clear and meaningful data visualizations (line charts, bar charts) using Matplotlib.

Developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit with filters for region, product, and date range.

Presented actionable business insights and recommendations based on sales and profit patterns.

Structured the project with clean code, reusable functions, and proper documentation for industry readiness.
